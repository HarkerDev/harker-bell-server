# Google Assistant

There's an even easier way to access the bell schedule and lunch menu—using the Google Assistant. This works on any device with Google Assistant enabled, including Android phones, Apple phones (with the Google Assistant app), and select smart speakers. Try it out now!

## Getting the bell schedule

We have provided several types of commands for accessing the bell schedule.

> **Hey Google, tell me the bell schedule for tomorrow.**

> **Hey Google, tell me the bell schedule on December 1st.**

The rest of the commands listed on this page require the prefix, **"ask HarkerDev,"** due to the way Google handles implicit command invocation.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev for the bell schedule next Friday.~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the bell schedule today?~~** Coming soon!

You can also ask for more timely information. This can be useful during the school day or between classes.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the next period?~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, when does the next period start?~~** Coming soon!

## Getting the lunch menu

You can access the lunch menu in a similar way.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the lunch menu today?~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's at Fresh Mex tomorrow?~~** Coming soon!
